Sany Metz rules, Sonar Uncle Bob Use Case Driven etc.
1. Your class can be no longer than 100 lines of code.
2. Your methods can be no longer than 5 lines of code.
3. You can pass no more than four parameters and you can't just make it one big hash.
4. You Rails controller can only instantiate one object to do whatever it is that needs to be done.
5. You Rails view can only know about one instance variable.
6. Your Rails view should only send messages to that variable/object i.e., no Demeter violations.
The idea is to follow the rules, see where it leads
